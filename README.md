# mathias_mini_data_analysis

##2021-10-09 - Milestone1

This milestone refers to the files named *Minidata* (.md and .rmd).

The 1st part of the data analysis was done. This 1st part consisting in 3 parts:

1. Choosing a data set

2. Exploring the chosen data set

3. Determining 4 research questions associated to this data set

In addition to this *README.md* file, you can find

* a *.gitignore* file which is an automatically generated file 
* a *.Rproj* file which is automatically generated by R studio
* *Minidata.Rmd* that should be opened with Rstudio to appreciate its content
* *Minidata.md* and *Minidata_files* that are associated, and you can open the .md file directly from github and see the graphs

For this 1st milestone of the mini data analysis, I had to look at data available "datateachr" package, and explore them a bit to define one that I would like to study more. 

I chose the data set *vancouver_trees*, as it presents variables that are numerical and chains of character that are short and simple to analyze. The 4 questions I defined are:

1. *What is the evolution of trees plantation with the years?*
2. *With the variability in the number of trees per neighborhood, can we also find some prevalence in some species for each neighborhood?*
3. *Is there a trend in the type of trees that are planted over the years?*
4. *Is there an evolution of the physiological properties of the trees (diameter and height), depending on the year? Are these properties related to any other variables of the tibble?*

##2021-10-20 - Milestone 2

This milestone refers to the files named *mini-project-2* (.md and .rmd).

This is the 2nd part of the data analysis. For this 2nd part, I explored more the data set *vancouver_trees*:

* I look into it by summarizing data and plotting graphs related to the 4 research questions I defined in the milestone 1

For this part, guidelines were given to help us in the exploring of the data set:
** For the **question1**, I realized the tasks **#3** and **#8**
** For the **question2**, I realized the tasks **#4** and **#5&7**
** For the **question3**, I realized the tasks **#2** and **#5**
** For the **question4**, I realized the tasks **#1** and **#6,7**


* I untidied and tidied back the data set

Finally I chose to keep the questions 2&3 and 4 for the milestone 3.
