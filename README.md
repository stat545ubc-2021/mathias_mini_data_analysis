# mathias_mini_data_analysis

## 2021 1st Winter term

### **What is this repository?**

This repository was created for the mini data analysis of the course STAT545A, UBC.

This MDA was realised by **Mathias Delhaye**, 1st year PhD student in the Neuroscience Program. 

The goal of this MDA was to perform a 1st analysis using R, to get use to the different possibilities that offers this coding language for data analysis. 

### **What contains this repository?**

This MDA was divided in 3 parts, which are all connected together and contained in their **own folder**. A forth folder, **output**, can be found containing the output of the 3rd part of this MDA.

The 3 parts of this MDA have to be explored in the order (from 1 to 3) in order to get the logic of this analysis. 

### **What to expect in each part of the MDA**

* MDA1: exploring some datasets from the **datateachr** package, selecting one (**vancouver_trees**) and determining research questions

* MDA2: summarizing data contained in the selected dataset and plotting graphs, tidy and untidy the dataset, selecting 2 research questions

* MDA3: explore special types of data contained the selected dataset (factors and dates), fit a model on the dataset, predict values based on the model determined and created exported file (csv and RDS)
